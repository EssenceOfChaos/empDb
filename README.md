## Development server

Use `yarn install` to install the dependencies.

Run `yarn run dev` to run the angular dev server and Node. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To run the application in development, make sure the correct env vars are uncommented to allow for cross site resource sharing. Also, uncomment the call to require cors in `server.js`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
